              <strong class="d-block text-gray-dark">How do I make a payment?</strong>
              For regular cleaning services, payments are made before or at the time of each clean. Our payment method is by debit or credit card. For one-off cleans a minimum of a 50% deposit will be required at the time of booking and the rest of the payment on the day of cleaning.

              <strong class="d-block text-gray-dark">Can you clean after business hours?</strong>
              We can clean before, during or after business hours. However, we prefer to perform the service during the week outside your operating hours or on weekends, so as not to interrupt your business. <br><br>

              If a normal working day happens to be a public holiday, the service will be performed on the following business day. Cleaning visits may be cancelled during long holidays such as Christmas and Easter.<br><br>

              Monday - Friday 8am till 10pm<br>
              Saturday - Sunday 8am till 8pm<br>
              Public Holiday - Closed on most public holidays.<br>

              <strong class="d-block text-gray-dark">Do you charge fixed prices or hourly prices?</strong>
              We believe that a fixed inclusive price is more economical and leads to higher cleaning quality, however we charge a separate hourly rate for any add odd-ons on your regular cleaning package. Our main advantages of fixed prices over hourly rates are:<br><br>

              Cost Advantage: It is a well-known marketing strategy to under-price a basic service and overprices its add-ons. In the vast majority of cases, the extra cleaning hours as well as the overheads needed to organise cleaning add-ons, result in the fixed prices approach being cheaper than hourly rates.<br><br>

              Better Quality: Conflict of the responsibility for cleaning results is likely to happen if the client and the cleaner can’t agree on a limit for the extra time. Fixed prices avoid this conflict from happening, while minimising interruptions to the client's business. This results in getting the expected cleaning quality at the agreed price.<br><br>

              Feather Lady is an outsourced cleaning service provider rather than a traditional cleaning agency. We provide fixed price all-inclusive cleaning services, designed specially to suit businesses and Individuals' cleaning needs. We want to build a sustainable long-term relationship with you, help you budget accurately, save on overheads of organising cleaning add-ons, and most importantly, we want to always keep your house spotlessly clean with minimum interruptions to your house.<br><br>

              <strong class="d-block text-gray-dark">Do you provide cleaning products & equipment?</strong>
              While some cleaning companies travel with equipment from one job to another, we advise against it. This way there is no transfer of dirt, germs, allergens, or debris from one house to the next. In order for us to maintain our high cleaning standards, we require that all our clients have their own equipment. We provide non- toxic cleaning products at an extra cost, and provide our clients with an easy obtainable list of equipment. Equipment list can be discussed with one of our client care specialists based on your home, and we will only recommend the best and most important cleaning equipment for you. No time to shop for equipment? No problem! One of our client care specialist can assist you.

              <strong class="d-block text-gray-dark">Will you send the same cleaning staff all the time?</strong>
              We try our best to send the same cleaning staff each time – it’s the most efficient set up for all of our clients – but we do not guarantee it. While we are pretty good at maintain the same cleaner, however if you are sent an alternate staff, our staff have access to detailed information about your preferences and requests to ensure consistency with our work. You are welcome to let us know if you have a preferred cleaning staff and we will make every reasonable effort to have them service your home.

              <strong class="d-block text-gray-dark">What do you mean by non-toxic cleaning products?</strong>
              We consider a cleaning product to be non-toxic if it doesn't have the potential to cause personal injury or illness when it is absorbed through the skin or as a result of reasonably foreseeable use.<br><br>

              We strive to be an environmentally conscious cleaning company and our staffs are trained to use most gentle and effective cleaning solutions in your house. While we are open to your wishes unfortunately we will not use bleach in your house due to its dangerous and toxic fumes.

              <strong class="d-block text-gray-dark">What if something is broken or damaged during cleaning?</strong>
              Our staffs are careful and considerate of each house they clean; every effort is made to be as careful as possible with your items. However accidents do happen if something gets broken or damaged notification must be made within 24 hours of breakage/loss of any personal items. Once reported to the office we will contact you to discuss a fair and quick resolution. Items which are antique, irreplaceable, hard to find, etc. are not covered by our breakage policy.  Please remove these items the day of your cleaning or we can clean around the items without moving them.
